# BlackJack_game
This project simulates the card game Blackjack. Players aim to reach 21 points or less with card values. The player decides to "hit" (get more cards) or "stand" (keep their cards). The dealer plays by fixed rules. The goal is to create a simple program that tracks scores and decides the winner.
